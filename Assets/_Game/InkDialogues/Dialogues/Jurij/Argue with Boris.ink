I killed him... He was my friend, but his belief that our country is perfect would lead to the annihilation of reality as we know it. Killing, however... should not be the solution. #name:Jurij
Was I right that it was a necessity? Could I have found another way? #name:Jurij
Was I victorious over his naivety, or did I just become part of the same dark game? #name:Jurij
I know one thing, I will not destroy the world for the beliefs of some Leader. I have to take the plunge. Finish Shimura's work and show the world what's going on here. #name:Jurij
-> END
