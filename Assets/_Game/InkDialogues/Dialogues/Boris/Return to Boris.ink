I've checked the parameters, everything is normal. The virus will gradually spread in the test rooms, the test subjects should manifest symptoms within a few days. #name:Boris
We start with room 0, the system will register the subject's changes. If all goes well, subjects in subsequent rooms will be infected. #name:Boris
So can we have a rest? #name:Jurij
We can. #name:Boris
