Finally, our Sleeping Beauty is awake #name:Boris #addNote:1
Get off me. I haven’t had time to properly wake up and you already have a problem. It will be while for this project to finish, so we better get along somehow. #name:Yurij
Calm down, princess. Just joking. It’s time to focus on the project. By the way, we should speed up the research a bit. Long before this project started, there was talk of war. We don’t want to let our countryman down. #name:Boris
This war has already been going on for several years, but so far, apart from the tactical marches nothing is happening. We don’t have to worry about it. Better tell me how  the ship’s reading are. #name:Yurij
Vessel parameters normal, virus is secured. You are always in the wrong. If there was no need for this project, it wouldn’t be organized so quickly. #name:Boris
If you are right, then it’s better we are in space. (laughter) #name:Yurij

How’s the schedule for today looking, comrade? #name:Yurij
The schedule for today is laid out by our beloved “I’m always right” lady. #name:Boris
(side eye) #name:Shimura
Anyway, scratch that. This will be the biggest bioengineering project in history. Only our Mother and the principles established in her could have pushed us so far forward. We are slowly becoming gods in a new world. This virus is a display of strength and capabilities. #name:Boris
It’s time to start the research and get as much as we can from this samples. #name:Yurij
Well said. I already know what I have to do. You go to Shimura for your assignment. #name:Boris
