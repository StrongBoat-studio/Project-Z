The progression of mutations is astonishingly fast. I didn't think that watching this process would awaken mixed feelings in me. I'm honored to be the one to work on it, but... the sight of these transformed people. Can they still be called human? The mutation has animalized them, turned them into beasts. I'm not sure that bringing the virus to Earth is a good idea.
...
Regardless, I'll stick to the plan.
