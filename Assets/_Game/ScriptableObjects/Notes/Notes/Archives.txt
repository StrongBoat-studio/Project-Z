The momentous time is fast approaching. The day so eagerly awaited by me. The biggest scientific research project in almost 50 years... I still can't believe I'm participating in it. The team is small, and the demands are huge. I can't slip up. I will give 200% of myself!!!
It will change..., I will change the fate of these endless conflicts. To the glory of the motherland.
